# Frogger Game

After learning JavaScript for 3 weeks, our task was to build a freestyle game. 
We built it for a week and it's really half-baked, but I am proud of it, 
because it's playable and it was full of fun to make it. 
At that time, we had not yet learned how to organize the code into units 
and how to use clean code in the case of JavaScript, 
so refactoring the project is necessary in the future.


## Tech Stack
